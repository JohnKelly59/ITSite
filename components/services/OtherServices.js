                    Massage Therapy: Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT): Massage
                    Therapy is an accepted component of physical rehabilitation
                    programs. It is the manipulation of superficial and deeper
                    layers of muscle and connective tissue using various
                    techniques, to enhance function, aid in the healing process,
                    decrease muscle reflex activity, inhibit motor-neuron
                    excitability, promote relaxation and well-being.

                    It is also proven beneficial for many chronic conditions,
                    and it promotes relaxation. Massage also helps relieve the
                    stress and tension of everyday living that can lead to many
                    illnesses such as lower back pain, arthritis, bursitis,
                    fatigue and high blood pressure.
